# Decision Tree Learning Project
This is a project I completed for CS 411 Artificial Intelligence I. It uses an ID3 algorithm to create a decision tree. In this example, the decision tree reveals what attributes are most important to customers when it comes to selecting a resteraunt to make a reservation at.
